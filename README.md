# Simple Lisp Interpreter

## That's pretty much it, this is just a simple lisp interpreter
It is written in C and right now only implements a few lisp functions:
car
cdr
cons
nullp
atomp
listp
equal (partially working, there are some bugs that need to be fixed)
there are plans to implement other functions, but it might take a while.
enjoy the lispy goodness!
